# Caleb Heller – Cybersecurity Portfolio Website

🔗 https://calebheller.vercel.app

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site highlights my work as a **Vulnerability Analyst** with a focus on **automation, reporting, and risk reduction**, along with selected projects, skills, and a direct contact form.

## Focus Areas
- Vulnerability management & risk prioritization  
- Python automation for security reporting and workflows  
- Data visibility and actionable security insights  
- Process improvement and noise reduction in security operations  

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Formspree (contact form handling)  
- Vercel (deployment)  
- Git & GitHub  

The site is intentionally simple, responsive, and fast — designed to clearly communicate my technical focus and make it easy to connect.
